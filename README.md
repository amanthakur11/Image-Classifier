# Image-Classifier
Under this project I have build an deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Network which is capable of classifying the different images of 10 different class like cat,dog,vehicle ect. The model is trained by the dataset from kaggle which contains 50000 training images having 5000 images of each class and 22000 testing images.
