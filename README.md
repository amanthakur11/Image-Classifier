# Image-Classifier
Under this project I have build an deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Network which is capable of classifying the different images of 10 different class like cat,dog,vehicle ect. The model is trained by the dataset from kaggle which contains 50000 training images having 5000 images of each class and 22000 testing images.

# Prerequisites
OpenCv<br/>
Tensorflow<br/>
Tflearn<br/>
Pandas<br/>
Numpy

# Getting Started
Describing about the dataset- training dataset contains images with number as thier name they don't have the label in thier name, for label I have a csv file named as trainLabel which contains two coloumn first one conatins the number which is written as the name of the image and second coloumn conatains corresponding labels.<br/>
To create the training dataset, testing dataset, train the model and test it you only have to run <a href="https://github.com/amanthakur11/Image-Classifier/blob/master/10class_classification.py" target="_blank">10class_classification.py </a> file, I have written all the code in same python file with corresponding so that it would be easy to understand. Before running this file please check that you given all the addresses of training and testing file right.
